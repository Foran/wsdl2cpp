# A cpp client/server code generator for SOAP 1.2 services defined via WSDL
This project is in the early development stage and after a long break is receiving active attention. Due to multiple significant periods of inactivity, the development has become more formailzed to facilitate continued progress through future breaks. Specifically Unit testing has become a significant focus.

This project was started due to the significant lack of a good open source solution for C++ code generators for SOAP 1.2
